**Step - 1 :**
Create Frequency map:
1.1 Iterate thru the given nums[] array
1.2. With each iteration - check if map already contains current key
If current key is already in the map just increase the value for this key
Else add key value pair.
Where key is current int and value is 1 (1 -> we encounter given key for the first time)
